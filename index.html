			<p>The North remembers. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. Our Sun Shines Bright. Our Sun Shines Bright. The winds of Winter. Hear me roar! Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. More pigeon pie, please. The wolf and the lion.</p>

			<p>House Tarly of Horn Hill The battle of the redgrass field. May the Father judge him justly. Fire and blood. And now his watch is ended. All men must die. The rains of castamere. The War of the 5 kings. House Tarly of Horn Hill Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. A dance of dragons. Can a man still be brave if heâ€™s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.The night is dark and full of terrors. The battle of the redgrass field. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. What is dead may never die. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.</p>
